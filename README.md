# Teaching Automation

Teaching automation is a technology for saving teachers work and time. It must be very useful for teachers and students but has not got much attention so far. 
Teaching automation is not going to replace the human teachers. In stead, it assist human teachers with high and remote availability, high teaching quality and more learning effectivness.  
I have been researching teaching automation technology in most recent years. I defined a Teaching Automation Script Language (TASL); built a platform for TASL editing, execution, and scripts management; and built a number of tools for teaching activities.
